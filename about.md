## About Me

My name is Steve and I'm a software engineer in the Greater Boston Area.
I worked with .NET technologies primarily up until late 2018.
Since then I've been working in Scala and it's been an incredible experience.
Aside from writing microservices in Scala, I've also been known to dabble in
front-end development, dev ops with Docker/Kubernetes/Helm, and a bit of light
data science from time to time.
When I'm not writing code, I enjoy cooking, walks, hiking, and my favorite
hobby, homebrewing.
I'd like to keep my blog primarily tech-focused, but perhaps if I can weave my
hobbies into the tech somehow, I'll write about those from time to time.
