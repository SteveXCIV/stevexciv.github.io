# stevexciv.github.io

Hi there! This repository hosts the source files that power my personal blog,
accessible at [stevexciv.com](https://stevexciv.com).

The site is built with [Zola](https://getzola.org), a Rust-based static site generator (SSG).
It uses the excellent theme [tabi](https://github.com/welpo/tabi), made by Óscar Fernández.
I host using GitHub Pages; the depoloy workflows are under the `.github/` subdirectory.
