I'm a software engineer that's been working professionally since 2015.
Once upon a time, I did everything from robotic control systems to data analytics
for industrial IOT systems, with a bit of DevOps mixed in.

Nowadays, I write lots of Java to build and maintain a massive-scale data platform
with my current employer, HubSpot.
When I write code not for work, it's all Rust all the time ðŸ¦€.
