blog was about how I couldn't make a Jekyll theme I liked\nso I just ended up choosing a default one.\nWell, things are a lot different now than when I wrote that.\nWith GitHub supporting a full suite of CI/CD goodies and having a pretty good\nfree tier, Jekyll is far from the only (good) option for getting a site on GH\npages.\nI never really knew much Ruby anyway, so it was right about that moment that I\ndecided to seek out another static site generator (SSG).\n\nEnter Zola\nIf the 🦀 crab emoji on my homepage's \"about me\" blurb didn't give it away, I\nlike Rust.\nNot the reddish brown stuff that weathers ferrous items, but the programming\nlanguage that continues to take the world by storm.\nWhen considering what SSG I wanted to go with, it was important to me that I\nfound one in a language that I, a: know, and b: enjoy working with.\nRust checks both of these boxes for me, so I was pretty happy when I came across\nZola.\nZola is written in Rust, which to me means that I can troubleshoot it more easily,\nand I could potentially contribute at some point down the line.\nI looked around a bit and also ended up finding the excellent theme tabi.\nIt's loaded with configuration to customize my blog exactly how I please,\nit's secure by default, and the project's own GH pages\nuses tabi (of course), and serves as project documentation - neat.\nZola also has excellent documentation for getting set up on GH Pages, and there's\na custom GH Action for deploying.\nOverall, I'm quite happy with how this turned out.\nSo maybe this time around I'll actually take the time to write about some of\nthe things I'm working on in my personal time 😅.\nAll-in-all, it's been a good weekend doing some spring cleaning, and now my blog\nis powered by Rust, and that's always a plus.\n","id":"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/back-to-blogging/","title":"Back to Blogging"},"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/creative-coding-generating-banner-images/":{"body":"\nCreative Coding: Generating Banner Images\nShortly after revitalizing this blog, I also\ndecided to join Mastodon as a way to provide updates on my blogging journey.\nAs I was working on getting a verified badge for my site URL, I noticed the\nconspicuous absence of a banner image on my profile.\nI had my profile picture ready-to-go, but I've never needed a banner image before.\nWhat did I decide to do? Well, write some code of course!\nBelow, I'll talk through library/framework selection, my general thought process,\nand describe how I arrived at the (very) rough implementation I did.\nIf you just want to see the code, that's here.\n\nPicking a Theme\nOk, so I decided to generate some banner art.\nThe question then is: what do I want to generate?\nI decided for now to keep it nice and simple, and reach for the tried and true\nMidpoint Displacement algorithm - in two dimensions, you might see this called\nthe \"Diamond-Square algorithm\" (wiki).\nMidpoint Displacement is a fairly low-effort way to get some decent looking\nmountains.\nSince it's a fractal algorithm, it works well for generating visuals without an\nobvious cyclic pattern.\nThis tends to make better looking mountain silhouettes, than say, a composition\nof sinunsoids, which would appear much more regular.\nA developer by the name of Paul Martz wrote up an excellent description of the\nalgorithm in an article called \"Generating Random Fractal Terrain\".\nUnfortunately, the website hosting this article seems to have gone offline\nsome time ago.\nLuckily, archive.org has plenty of captures.\nI probably would not trust any code downloads linked there to be valid, but\nthe textual descriptions are still quite good.\nRestating, I think, is one of the best ways to understand a concept, so I'll\noutline the algorithm in TL;DR fashion here:\n\nStart with a pair of points; at the min and max X-coordinate of your image, respecively\nRepeat some N number of times:\n\nFor each pair of points:\n\nAdd a new point between the two, and displace this point on the Y-axis by some displacement amount\nReduce the magnitude of the displacement amount using some smoothing factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidpoint Displacement in Rust\nOnce I settled on what I wanted to generate, it was time to get some hands-on-keyboard\ntime.\nOne thing I really like to think about whenever I'm doing a project, in any language,\nis what the language and its ecosystem offers.\nWhen I first began this project, I went through a similar process with Rust.\nAt the onset, I thought it might be neat to use pattern matching to recursively\ngenerate splits of line segments into smaller segments.\n\nInitial Brainstorm\nI brainstormed something like this:\n\nNow, if you're an experienced Rustacean, you'll probably see a problem with this\napproach.\nIf you're new to Rust, the issue might be lost on you because it's quite subtle.\nOne of the things that Rust programmers need to be cognizant of is the size of\ndata types.\nThe compiler needs to be able to determine, at compile time, how much memory\nevery instance of a given data type needs to allocate.\nLet's take a closer look at our implementation and try to figure that out.\nSo, for the case of a Segment, determining the data size is quite simple,\nsince it's two 32-bit floats, and those have a fixed size.\nNow then, what about the memory required for a Node?\nWe could look at the simplest possible Node, which would look something like:\n\nWell, then we have a problem.\nSince we could technically create a Path with of infinitely nested Nodes,\nit's simply not possible to determine the size in this case.\nThe upper bound of our data type's size is infinite, and the compiler cannot\nwrite an instruction to allocate infinite memory.\nIn fact, if we try to compile, the compiler helpfully informs us that this is\nthe case:\n\nThe compiler also helpfully proposes a fix for us, using some indirection.\nWhat this means, in other words, is to structure the data type in such a way\nthat a Node takes up a fixed size, by heap-allocating the inner Paths.\nThis turns them into pointers, which have a fixed size.\nUltimately, I decided against doing this.\nMy reasoning was that I didn't think this design was actually going to provide\nme as much value as I initially thought.\nI might revisit this at a later point, but it was a fun diversion.\n\nThe Actual Approach\nI ended up going with something a little more \"traditional\", for lack of a\nbetter term.\nThis approach looks and feels a lot like what you might see in C++, Java, or\nother well-known languages.\nIt's also not all that heavy on Rust language features, and has some\npanicking code sprinkled in, but that's all a future refactor waiting to happen.\nFor starters, I sketched out what I'd need to implement this algorithm.\nI landed on:\n\na number of steps (this is N in the pseudocode above)\nan initial_displacement, or how much noise there should be on the first recursive step\na smoothness value, or how much to reduce displacement per recursive level\n\nThat landed me on this function signature:\n\nLet's unpack this.\nWe see here that our function takes the three parameters mentioned above, as well\nas some rng (more on that shortly), and it returns a vector of f32.\nAs for implementation, we roughly want to do something like:\n\nstart with an empty vector with enough capacity for steps number of subdivisions\npopulate the initial endpoints with a value (these will be the start and end of the vector)\nrepeat steps number of times:\n\ncompute the midpoint for each pair of points\ndisplace the midpoint by a random amount, bounded by the current displacement\nreduce the displacement amount using smoothness\n\n\n\nReading this over, we can see that we need some source of (pseudo-)randomness in\norder to generate displaced midpoints.\nThat's where our parameter rng comes in, it's our source of (pseudo-)randomness.\nThe function signature includes this &lt;R: Rng&gt; - that's called a trait bound\nin Rust.\nWhat we're telling the compiler is that this function is generic over some type\nR, and only types that implement the trait Rng are valid.\nWhat is Rng, you may ask? It's the core trait in the very popular\nrand\ncrate in the Rust ecosystem.\nOk, now that we've squared that away, let's talk implementation details.\nSince I planned on implementing this as a recursive function, I went with the\ntried and true pattern of creating a \"wrapper\" function that computes all the\ninitial state, and an additional function that does the recursive step.\nI sketched out this signature for the recursive step, which I called fill:\n\nA couple of things to note here:\nThis function takes in a mutably-referenced Vec&lt;Option&lt;f32&gt;&gt; instead of a Vec&lt;f32&gt;.\nI did this to leverage Rust's Option type to denote to-be-computed points,\nrather than using a sentinel value like 0.0.\nThis, in my opinion, is a better design because the compiler forces us to address\nboth the None and Some(...) cases explicitly, rather than just assuming a value\nexists.\nAlso, floating point equality has a bunch of gotchas associated with it, which I\nwanted to sidestep, and 0.0 is a perfectly valid value for a point, so there's\nno guarantee this algorithm couldn't accidentally overwrite previously computed\npoints in the case of a bug.\nThe function also takes two indices called i and j - these will control which\nsubsection of the vector each recursive call operates on.\nFinally, I wrote a quick helper function to compute the index of a midpoint,\ngiven an i and j index.\nThis is pretty straightforward so I'm just going to drop the implementation in here:\n\nFinally, following my textual descriptions above, I implemented the other two\nfunctions as follows:\n\nI won't deep dive into every line here, but I'll pick out a couple of specifics\nto go over.\nI compute new_displacement like this:\n\nThis is borrowed from the math in Paul Martz' blog post that I linked above.\nIf you're like me though, you like to work out the math as you translate it to\ncode to make sure you understand what you're doing.\nThis computation is fairly trivial, but it's still a thing I like to do, personally.\nSince $x^0 = 1, \\space \\forall x$ and $x^{-y} = {1 \\over {x^y}}$, we can quickly\ncompute the following test values:\nsmoothnessMultiplicative Factor\n0.01.0\n0.5~0.707\n1.00.5\n\nOk, so this computation maps smoothness to a value between 0.0 and 1.0,\nand as smoothness grows, the resulting computation shrinks, resulting in\nnew_displacement being less-than-or-equal to displacement.\nMakes sense.\nThen, there's also this little section at the bottom of compute_points:\n\nThis is a use of Rust's powerful iterators.\nIn short, this function is doing the following:\n\ninto_iter() converts our Vec&lt;Option&lt;f32&gt;&gt; into an iterator;\nthis method consumes the vector, meaning we are taking ownership\nof its valeus\nfilter_map(...) operates on an iterator, each element is mapped to an\nOption, and those which yield a Some(...) value are retained\n\nstd::convert::identity is the identity function - since our values are\nalready Option&lt;T&gt;, this works out quite elegantly\n\n\ncollect() collects our iterator back into a collection, we specify a vector here\n\nThis is one of the things I really love about Rust - this small expression is\ndoing so much, and yet, it remains quite readable.\nNow with the core algorithm out of the way, I need a way to display things on\nscreen.\n\nEnter Nannou\nNannou is a creative coding framework for Rust.\nIf you've ever played aroubnd with something like Processing, Nannou is\nconceptually similar.\nIf this is all new to you, the TL;DR is: the Nannou framework allows you to\nquickly and easily spin up programs that produce audiovisual effects.\nNannou can also do some cool stuff with lasers and other kinds of AV hardware,\nbut I'm not well-versed enough to write about any of that.\nIn my opinion, rapid prototyping is pretty important when your output is visual.\nYou really want to be able to get something on the screen and build on it as\nquickly as possible.\nNannou makes it very easy to get started with getting something on the screen,\nvia their sketch concept.\nThen, once you want more functionality, you can use the regular Nannou app.\nI'll skip over copy-pasting a ton of boilerplate and just link to a commit here,\ncommit ce5415b\nhas the first iteration of a nannou sketch to draw mountains on screen.\nIt's barebones, and I personally don't think it's all that pretty, but it works.\nIt generates something that looks like this, more or less:\n\n\nFilling in the Outline\nThis outline looks vaguely mountain-like, but it's just an outline.\nTo fill it in, I add a handful of extra points outside the bounds of the screen,\nlike so:\n\nCombining iter::once() and chain() makes it quick and easy to do this.\nI also added basic keyboard interaction to avoid recompiling every time I wanted\na new image.\nPressing space now regenerates the mountain image.\nThat code is in commit 34b4e59.\nThis generates mountains that look a bit more.. mountainy.\n\n\nMultiple Layers\nNow that I had some vaguely mountain-shaped polygon on my screen, I decided to\nexpand the program a bit more to support layers.\nThe idea is that a Layer struct could wrap a set of points as well as a\n\"baseline\" Y coordinate.\nThis would allow me to draw multiple mountain ranges stacked on top of each other,\ngiving the illusion of distance, or something like that.\nWhile I was at it, I also added in the colorgrad\ncrate for some nice gradients, and wrote a very simple wrapper type to allow me\nto convert colorgrad colors into Nannou colors.\nI sample the gradients based on which layer I'm rendering in order to get\nevenly-spaced colors for each layer.\nThat code can be found in commit 51b18ea.\n\nWrapping it Up (for now)\nFinally, I added three very small final adjustments for the time being.\nFirst, I renamed some variables and parameters to read more easily.\nSecondly, I adjusted the default screen size to match the dimensions I was after.\nThird, I made it so pressing the S key saves the image to the current\nworking directory.\nWhen all was said and done, I ended up with the following image, which,\nat the time of writing, adorns my Mastodon profile:\n\nThis version of the code is commit 56e5fe3.\n\nFinal Notes\nBefore I sign off on this post, I want to address a couple of issues with this\ncode.\nThis project is very much so what my CS 4500 professor would have called a\n\"garage program\".\nEssentially, it's in a rough state, it looks like something I whipped up in my\ngarage.\nFrankly, it kind of is, just sub \"garage\" out for \"living room couch\".\nHere's a list of things I definitely want to come back and address to make this\nprogram more useful and more.. complete?\n\nthere are no tests anywhere in sight; the UI is probably the heaviest lift\nhere, but there's no reason the basic algorithm can't be tested\neverything is shoved into a main.rs file; the program is quite small now,\nbut keepng everything in main.rs is not scalable\nit's not possible to specify any parameters; there aren't \"magic numbers\",\nbut if the parameters can be named, they can be converted into command line args\n\none could imagine specifying steps, displacement, smoothness, gradient, etc.\n\n\nthere's no non-interactive mode, you need to run the GUI to generate an image\nthis is kind-of a limitation of Nannou because it's built around a windowing\nsystem, however, it is possible to run one frame then exit\nperhaps in the future, there could be more image generators than just \"mountains\"\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks so much for reading!\nI want to continue blogging about this project as I build it out, stay tuned for\nmore.\n","id":"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/creative-coding-generating-banner-images/","title":"Creative Coding: Generating Banner Images"},"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/giving-golang-a-try/":{"body":"In this post, I'll document my experience building an app in Go, which is a new-to-me language.\nKeep reading if you want to know more about how I built this, and my first impressions of Go.\nIf you just want to see the code, hop on over to the repository.\n\nBackground\nIf you know me, or you've read my writing before, you'll know that I'm a Java developer by day, and a Rustacean by night.\nI've also done some Python here and there as the situation called for, but that's been about all I've worked with in the past 5 years or so.\nWhile I don't think Java will ever go away, and I still love Rust, I was itching to try something new.\nFor a moment, let's rewind back to late 2019, I was working with a small group on a project that I was pretty excited about.\nIt was a Python app that, at the time, we felt had a lot of potential.\nUnfortunately, however, that project ended up fizzling out, but I still remember one thing from back then.\nThe software we had been building processed near real-time data from multiple feeds, and we were quickly outgrowing Python.\nWe'd been talking for some time about a Go port, because one of our contributors was familiar with Go.\nI never got a chance to explore Go back then, and I don't really like leaving things unfinished.\nNow that I was looking for something new, I decided to just Go for it.\n\nDeciding What to Build\nI remember I had a professor back in undergrad that loved to use the \"Lazy developers are good developers\" line.\nThat professor would be proud because I got a bit lazy when picking a project.\nI fired up a chat session with an LLM and asked for a project plan to learn about Go.\nSpecifically, I requested approximately 8 hours of work, basic but flexible requirements, and some focus areas for my learnings.\nMy plan was to treat this as I would any LLM output: a starting point that I would then workshop with my own human intuition.\nThe plan that I received was remarkably mundane: a simple TODO app with a CLI.\nI could have come up with this on my own, sure, but I was still thankful to have some notes to go off of.\nSo there I had my plan, I knew what I was going to build.\nI was going to make a simple TODO CLI that stored tasks as a JSON document and had basic CRUD operations - not bad.\nThe rest of this post details my experience building the application.\n\nGetting Started\nI began my Go journey at the docs.\nThere happens to be a conveniently-placed \"Get Started\" button which links to learning resources.\nTwo that I found particularly helpful were:\n\nA Tour of Go\nGo by Example\n\nI've always been an experiential learner, so I was thrilled to see that there's two example-based resources to learn from.\nAfter a brisk pass through the tour, and a couple of cherry-picked examples, I decided it was time to write some code.\n\nImplementation Experience\nNOTE: I've kept the plan docuement that I AI-generated in the repository as a reference.\nI've deviated from it in my actual implementation, but it still served as a decent scaffold.\n\nCreating the Task struct\nThe first step of the plan is to define the Task struct for storing our TODOs.\nThis sounds perfectly reasonable because this is going to be the primary data type we pass around.\nI settled on the following fields:\n\nId: a unique integer ID for tasks\nTitle: the name of the task\nPriority: an enum denoting the low/medium/high priority\nDueDate: when this task is due\nCategory: an optional user-provided category\nStatus: an enum denoting pending/complete state\n\nThis was my first encounter with Go-specific behaviors.\n\nEnums\nGo has no built-in \"enum\" type.\nInstead, enums are just constants with an opaque type alias.\nThey also typically use a built-in called iota which is a language feature more-or-less purpose-built for enums.\nGo by Example does a good job of explaining the enum pattern.\n\nIota\nIf you click through links from the \"Go by Example\" link above, you'll undoubtedly end up at the Go blog post on iota.\nThe iota build-in is essentially an incrementing counter that resets inside a new const declaration block.\nThe idea is that it's easy to assign incrementing values to enums:\n\nIt works well for this purpose, but it also has tons of other uses, and my first impression is that it may be too many.\n\nIota Iteratively Evaluates Expressions\nThe initial value can be an expression using iota.\nThis expression gets re-evaluated on each line, with the incrmented iota value:\n\nThis is convenient, but it's also a lot of functionality packed into one feature.\n\nIota - Conclusion\nI think that iota is definitely an interesting convenience feature, but I'm not sure yet how I feel about how clever it allows developers to get.\n\nField Naming\nMy first inclination with the Task struct was to use lower-case names for the fields.\nI understood that Go treats these as package-private and though it would be fine.\nI was operating under the impression that I'd start with private fields and make them public (i.e. use a TitleCase name) as needed.\nOne thing I didn't immediately realize, however, is that Go's built-in json module would ignore them.\nIn retrospect, this is a reasonable design decision.\nYou probably want your data objects to make all their meaningful fields public anyway; it also makes sense with how the Go implementation works (more on that later).\n\nJSON Field Names\nOne potential issue with this approach is that it couples the JSON field name with Go's convention-based access modifier system.\nLuckily, there's a way to decouple these.\nThe json module also uses something called \"struct tags\".\nThese are string literals that can appear next to struct fields.\nOther modules can access these values via reflection.\nThe json module has a DSL for controlling the conversion to JSON.\nSpeaking of JSON marshalling, I really like how the Go standard library makes it easy to define custom output formats for types.\nSince enums are actually just integers, by default they get written as integer literals in the JSON output.\nTwo easy function implementations can change that:\n\n\nThe Final Task Struct\nAfter all was said and done, I had a Task struct that:\n\nhas all fields listed above\nuses camelCase naming for JSON marshalling\nuses custom marshal/unmarshal string representation for all enums\n\nIt didn't take me very long, and the code was pretty straightforward and fun to write.\nI also went ahead and added some tests, because I had been abusing my poor main() function to manually test.\n\nCreating the Task Manager\nThe plan also mentioned creating a task manager class for providing the CRUD operations.\nBased on the generated examples, I came up with a design for the API.\nI originally started off with a Manager struct, but I switched to an interface for a couple of reasons.\nMy primary reason is that I like test driven development (TDD).\nInterfaces also make it quick and easy to make mock dependencies for testing very specfic scenarios.\nHere's what I ultimately ended up with:\n\nThe implementation is fairly simple and just uses a slice of Task and linearly iterates them for list/search.\nI could have done something more sophisticated like using maps to store indices, but I kept it simple.\nMy goal was just to learn Go, not to make the ideal TODO CLI.\nThere are a couple of things I do think are noteworthy about this design.\n\nThe getDueDate Function Pointer\nThe design doc examples showed being able to specify strings like \"today\" and \"tomorrow\" for the due date.\nI decided to capture these cases elsewhere in the code, so instead of having an API to specify \"special\" dates, the Manager just takes a function and passes its own now.\nThis also makes testing pretty comfy.\n\nPointers for Status and Priority\nThe ListTasks API is kind of interesting because it accepts status/priority for \"is equal to\"-style filtering.\nThere isn't a built-in Option type in Go, so I used pointers because their \"zero\" value is nil.\nThis works really nicely with how structs use the zero value for unspecified fields.\nIt means it I were to, for example, parse a \"command\" struct from the program arguments, I could leave the unspecified filtering arguments as nil very easily.\nSpeaking of, let's talk about the Command interface.\n\nCreating the Commands\nFor my CLI commands, I created a very simple interface, it has a single Execute method which takes a Manager and returns (string, error).\nHere's what that looks like in code:\n\nThen, in the same cli.go file, I stubbed out a top level Parse function, with this signature:\n\nI also stubbed out individual unexported helpers for parsing the individual commands.\nCommands more or less just delegate to Manager, but I do want to circle back one last time to AddCommand.\nThe struct looks like this:\n\nThe IntoDueDate type is a second interface I made:\n\nThis is how I manage computing the timestamp for the Manager.Add API!\nHere's an example with DueTomorrow:\n\nOnce I had all of the commands implemented, wiring everything up was easy!\n\nWiring it Up\nOne thing I really like about how this program turned out is just how simple everything is once it's all put together.\nThe entire main method is very digestable and doesn't even require scrolling the page on my monitor:\n\nJust like that, my first Go program was written!\n\nConclusion\nMy overall impression of Go is that it's a language written for getting things done quickly.\nThe language feature set is small.\nDefault behaviors are something you should be aware of and rely on.\nThe standard library is robust enough to get you writing code ASAP.\nWhat Go lacks in feature surface, it makes up for in having mostly sensible defaults.\nThat being said, there were some things I found odd or surprising.\nHere's a couple of highlights of things I liked and things I didn't.\n\nWhat I Liked\nMost defaults are sensible: do you have an int? Your zero value is 0.\nA string is empty by default, so there's no need for a dedicated empty-checking function, just compare equality with \"\".\nPointers are nil by default, so just be careful before trying to derefernce them.\nMost things behave the way you'd expect them to by default.\nTable driven testing: I said earlier that I love TDD.\nTable-driven tests are, in my opinion, tragically underutilized.\nThe fact that Go makes them so easy to write is a dream.\nExtremely strong standard library: I mentioned earlier that the Go standard libary is really nice.\nI never needed to leave the standard library while building this app.\nWhile the app isn't perfect, it is completely usable and didn't take long to build.\nI didn't mention earlier, but there's even a text/tabwriter utility (link) for printing out tables.\nI used text/tabwriter for printing the list and search command results.\nOther honorable mentions not used in this project include slog for structured logging and a fully-featured template engine.\nThat's just plain awesome.\n\nWhat I Disliked\nDate formatting: Go uses an example-based system for date format strings.\nInstead of yyyy-MM-dd, you say 2006-01-02, and therein lies the problem.\nGo by Example has some great, well, examples where you can see this in action.\nI stared at this reference time for a long, well, time.\nI eventually found out that this SO answer - as it turns out, the Go reference time is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 in the form month day hour minute second year zone-offset.\nI really do not like this.\nIt feels like an Easter egg hidden in the standard library.\nI don't mind the example-based format, but 1970-01-01 was already a perfectly decent epoch.\nNo Built-in Equals: Go does not allow types to redefine the behavior of ==.\nYou have to write your own Equals method.\nI found this a bit frustrating when writing tests, but luckily there's reflect.DeepEqual, which uses reflection, so it shouldn't be used in Production code.\nI do still find it a bit strange though, given how ergonomic it is to opt-into things like custom JSON marshalling.\nThis isn't something I'm losing any sleep over, though.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe obvious question is whether or not I'd use Go again.\nIn short, yes, I would.\nDepsite the small number of things I disliked, there was a lot to like.\nGo is small and fast, and that simplicity feels really nice.\nIn the past I had a habit of prototyping an idea in Python and then actually implementing it for real in Rust or Java.\nWith Go, I feel like I can skip the Python step.\n","id":"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/giving-golang-a-try/","title":"Giving Go a Try"},"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/zero-to-prototype-trying-out-the-mash-stack/":{"body":"\nZero to Prototype: Trying Out the MASH Stack\n\nWant to jump right into the code?

this is something I want to revisit\nclap and dotenvy for moving config out to the environment like a real app would\nserde to support form-encoded data the frontend will be sending\ntokio, tower-http, and the tracing* crates for general web server \"stuff\" and communicating to stdout via traces\n\nWhen all that was out of the way, I stood up the most basic hello world server as a starting point.\nThe main method did some basic setup before calling routes::create_router(), and my routes.rs file looked like:\n\nJust enough of a starting point that I could call cargo run and fire off a request via curl.\nNow it was time to actually use MASH.\n\nServing Maud Markup from Axum Handlers\nOne word that stuck with me from Evan Schwartz's blog post was \"synergy\".\nHe does a deep dive on some of the ergonomic benefits of the MASH stack and I recommend giving it a read.\nI will however echo his sentiment: the components of this stack fit together almost effortlessly.\nLet's take a look at a simple example with Maud's Markup type and the Axum integration feature.\nAt the risk of oversimplifying, Axum connects routes to handlers which are async functions that return some Response.\nAnything implementing Axum's IntoResponse trait can also be returned by a handler.\nMaud's axum feature provides an IntoResponse for Markup, which is the output of Maud's html! macro.\nIn short, it means that this is a valid handler:\n\nThis makes for a pretty seamless fit between Maud and Axum.\nHandlers are able to follow the general pattern of:\n\noptionally extract some data from the request/context\noptionally transform the data in some interesting way\ninject data into the template\nreturn rendered markup as a response\n\nIt's also worth noting that for extremely simple tools or UIs, this is already a ton of functionality with very little fanfare.\nThat being said, we still have half the stack's letters to go over, so let's keep going.\n\nInstalling HTMX and Vendoring Dependencies\nHTMX is the one part of this project that doesn't have an entry in Cargo.toml.\nThat's because it's a lightweight Javascript library, and incidentally, the only &lt;script&gt; tag actually needed.\nHTMX is available via unpkg CDN.\nThat being said, the HTMX docs link to this blog post by Wesley Aptekar-Cassels, about not using a CDN in production.\nGiven my general lack of expertise with the Javascript ecosystem, I would need to do more research to get into the details of Wesley's argument.\nThat being said, there are some compelling points there, and I thought that this would be a good chance to try something I hadn't seen other MASH projects do.\nSo, I decided to forego the CDN and vendor the HTMX source into my application.\nThis is where the tower_http direct dependency in Cargo.toml comes in.\nIt provides ServeDir (docs) to serve requests for files in a directory, which Axum can use directly as middleware.\nServeDir also comes with some nice features such as handling invalid requests gracefully and returning 404 Not Found for missing files.\nSetting it up was easy:\n\nThen, I went ahead and made a public/js directory in my project root, and downloaded htmx.min.js as well as its LICENSE file.\nOne thing I found cool about this pattern is it greatly simplifies compliance with licenses which require distributing them with the code.\nFinally, all that was left to do was link htmx.min.js into my Maud markup:\n\n\nNOTE: I use script ... {} here (closing brackets at the end) self-closing script tags are generally unsupported by browsers; there's a rabbit hole to go down, if you so desire.\n\nWith that done, the application frontend became ✨ dynamic ✨\nThe only problem is that there was no data to display at this point.\nIt was time to add persistent state and APIs for modifying the data.\n\nSQLx: A not-ORM for SQL in Rust\nSQLx says right in the README that it is not an ORM.\nHaving only tried Diesel in the past, this was a new and exciting experience for me.\nSQLx's approach to queries is a no-DSL, \"just write SQL\" approach - the minimalism is a big win for me.\nIt also offers really great out-of-the-box features such as migrations and compile-time query verification without mandating their use.\nI really appreciated this because it let me prototype without the burden of having to form my code around a specific toolchain or DSL.\nFor example, here's the Todo struct and the function that fetches all todos from the database:\n\nThat's it.\nOne derive, and a plain-old SQL query.\nMinimalism at its finest.\n\nEmbedding migrations and creating a pool\nI decided to forego the compile-time query verification for right now, but I did take advantage of SQLx's migration support.\nThis does mean using the SQLx CLI tool, so there is one extra cargo install sqlx-cli step, but I think it was worth it.\nI created a reversible migration with the CLI; the \"up\" portion which creates the todos table looks like this:\n\nSQLx gives you options when it comes to actually applying migrations.\nYou are able to use the CLI to prepare the database outside of your application code, but you can just as easily embed them in the application code.\nThis is really convenient; with a larger application you might want to run migrations one time as a pre-deploy step,\nbut in a smaller app or one where you're using in-memory SQLite, the same migration files just work.\nEmbedding migrations happens with the sqlx::migrate!() macro; here's the code I wrote for handling the database access:\n\nForgive the hardcoded path to the SQLite database file, please.\nAside from that, this code is simple and easy to work with.\nI just call create_pool().await? and I get back a connection pool ready-to-use, always on the latest table schema.\n\nTransactions\nSQLx also makes transactions pretty painless.\nThe only thing to remember is to manually commit the transaction, otherwise when it drops, it will roll back.\nHere's the function that toggles the completion state of a Todo:\n\nSince a read-then-write is necessary here, a transaction is required to ensure that the database is updated atomically.\nSQLx makes it very easy to do this.\n\nPutting it All Together\nLet's take a look at the Todo completion toggle end-to-end.\nIt's probably the most complex thing this app does, and it touches every part of the stack, so I think it's a good example of the stack in action.\nLet's zoom in on how individual todos are rendered for a moment:\n\nThere's a couple of things going on here, so let's break it down:\n\nThis function renders an &lt;li&gt; with a unique ID derived from the Todo\nInside the &lt;li&gt; are a &lt;label&gt; and a checkbox &lt;input&gt;\nThe &lt;label&gt; wraps the checkbox, making them behave as one unit in terms of clickability\nThe &lt;label&gt; also applies a strikethrough for completed Todos only\nThe &lt;input&gt; triggers a PUT /api/v1/todos/{todo.id}/toggle request when it is toggled (i.e. clicked on)\nThe results of this request swap the outerHTML (the whole element) of the parent &lt;li&gt; with the PUT request's response\n\nWith that all in mind, here's the actual handler code for toggling a Todo:\n\ntodos::toggle_todo is the function we saw earlier which changes the todo state within a transaction.\nFinally, the handler is wired up to the router like so:\n\nThis makes for a remarkably simple application structure that still provides a good level of interactivity.\nSimple, fast, and easy.\nThere's a lot to like here.\n\nClosing Thoughts\nThe MASH stack proved to be an excellent fit for projects with smaller scopes due to its convenience and seamless component integration.\nThis experience has left me feeling generally positive about the stack's potential, owing to its simplicity and flexibility.\nI recommend giving this stack a try if you're in need of a simple webapp and want to write it in Rust.\nI'm certainly going to be doing more investigation on my own to explore the potential of this stack.\nHowever, that being said, there are a couple of open questions that I'd like to explore more in the more immediate future.\nOne big one that's been on my mind throughout the entire project is testability.\nPart of this is admittedly my fault; the code I built could use a bit of a clean-up pass and better separation of concerns.\nRight now, views does a ton of heavy lifting, it renders data as markup and calls into the DAO functions of todos.\nA better design might be to add another layer where the data modifications take place, and then views just handles rendering.\nEnd-to-end testing would still be a concern though, given that the backend is sending out markup with functional meaning for the HTMX frontend.\nI've been doing some reading on testing HTMX applications, and I have some ideas I intend to try out.\nStay tuned for more updates as I delve deeper into these areas!\n","id":"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/zero-to-prototype-trying-out-the-mash-stack/","title":"Zero to Prototype: Trying Out the MASH Stack"},"https://www.stevexciv.com/projects/":{"body":"Here's a showcase of my personal favorite things I'm working on.\n","id":"https://www.stevexciv.com/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://www.stevexciv.com/tags/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.stevexciv.com/tags/","title":"All Tags"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.stevexciv.com/":{"body":41,"title":1},"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/back-to-blogging/":{"body":257,"title":2},"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/creative-coding-generating-banner-images/":{"body":1284,"title":5},"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/giving-golang-a-try/":{"body":1201,"title":3},"https://www.stevexciv.com/blog/zero-to-prototype-trying-out-the-mash-stack/":{"body":1037,"title":6},"https://www.stevexciv.com/projects/":{"body":7,"title":1},"https://www.stevexciv.com/tags/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":8},"lang":"English"}
